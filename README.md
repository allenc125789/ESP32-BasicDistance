## ESP32C3-based Received Signal Strength Indicator

Guages distance by adjusting the ESP32C3's wifi transmission power. The closer the transmitter gets to the reciever, the higher frequency the `distancePin` will light up.

Sends a simple bool statement, and if recieved, will power an LED and a piezo buzzer.
